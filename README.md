Vision
Empowering users to effortlessly create transparent and fair NFT lotteries with customizable odds, enhancing NFT liquidity and democratizing access to blockchain innovations by ERC-404.

Description
Our product seamlessly combines the innovative approach of a Factory Contract for generating customizable ERC-404 based NFT dNFT contracts with the VRFMain for distributing verifiable random variables, and integrates Uniswap for efficient token transfers within the ERC-404 ecosystem. This holistic solution enables users to not only create and participate in fair and transparent NFT lotteries but also to effortlessly swap tokens necessary for participation directly on the platform. Leveraging Uniswap's decentralized exchange technology within the ERC-404 framework ensures that users have immediate access to the tokens they need, enhancing liquidity and user experience. This integration streamlines the process of entering lotteries, making it more accessible and convenient, while maintaining the integrity and fairness of the dNFT system through secure and transparent random number generation. Our platform thus stands as a comprehensive ecosystem that democratizes access to blockchain innovations, making NFT lotteries fairer, more liquid, and easier to participate in for everyone.
